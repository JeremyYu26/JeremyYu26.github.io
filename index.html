<li >Hello everyone. Thanks for coming to my personal website. Sorry about my boring-colored background, but I think some fancy pictures might make this website messy so I just leave a pure-colored background here. My name is Jiazheng Yu. I come from China. You can just call me Jeremy since my Chinese name is extremely hard to pronounce. I'm a freshman at UIUC, and I'm enrolled in Division of General Studies. I want to transfer to majors that correlated with computer, such as Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Computer Science+. As you can see from the picture above, I also love cats. Besides computer and cats, I like to watch anime and manga such as Naruto and Fate series(I've posted an image of my favorite character,Okita Souji, in this anime below). I also like to go out and play. My favorite sport is cycling, and I enjoy the feeling of wind blowing on my face. Email me so we can talk more about our interests: jy21@illinois.edu</li>
